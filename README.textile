Vocabulario is a very lo-fi vocabulary trainer I more or less wrote for personal use only. Feel free to try it!

In order for it to work you need to install the following plugins:
* "acts_as_taggable_on_steroids":https://github.com/paceline/acts_as_taggable_on_steroids
* "acts_as_textiled":https://github.com/defunkt/acts_as_textiled
* "gravatar":https://github.com/westarete/gravatar-plugin

Required gems are listed in Gemfile.
