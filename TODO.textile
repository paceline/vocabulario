h1. TODOs

h2. Priority 1

* Only get asked own vocabulary
* Vocabularies as list for studying before test
  - Implement test-from-list
  - Print list
* Return error if no vocabularies found for selection (-> test)
* Finally fix sidebar wrapping and spacing issue

h2. Priority 2

* List of untagged vocabularies
* Make vocabulary only appear once on test (-> sometimes multiple translations exist)
* Warning that renaming breaks conjugation rules
* Stat center: Comparative analysis (you're best with vocabulary test tagged with intermediate)

h2. Priority 3

* Internationalization / Multi-language
